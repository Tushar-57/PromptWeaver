## Version_1 (Learning)

- **Intent Classification**: Uses zero-shot learning to classify user input into predefined intents (e.g., "learn", "explain", "compare").  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts and maps entities (e.g., "Technology", "Domain", "Tool") from user input.  
- **Template-Based Prompt Generation**: Dynamically selects and populates templates based on intent and extracted entities.  
- **Fallback Logic**: Ensures robust prompt generation by using general/default templates when specialized ones are unavailable.  
- **Hands-On Learning**: Includes projects and exercises to explore AI concepts and enhance coding skills.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Transformers Library**: For zero-shot classification and NER using pre-trained models.  
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.  
- **Configurable Templates**: JSON-based templates for flexible prompt generation.  
- **Logging and Debugging**: Tools for tracking and improving system performance.  

## Use Cases  
  
- **Educational Tools**: Create tailored prompts for learning and teaching.  
- **Content Creation**: Assist in generating structured content for blogs, tutorials, and more.  

## Learning Outcomes  

- Gain hands-on experience with NLP and AI models.  
- Understand zero-shot learning and entity recognition.  
- Learn to design and implement template-based systems.  
- Develop problem-solving skills for real-world AI applications.  

## Audience  

This repository is ideal for **developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts** looking to explore AI-driven prompt generation. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, this space offers opportunities to **learn, experiment, and create**.
