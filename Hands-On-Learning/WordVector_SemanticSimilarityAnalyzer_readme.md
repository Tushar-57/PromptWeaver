# üîç Semantic Similarity Analysis

## üìù Description
This document provides documentation for the `01_04_SemanticSimilarity.py` script. The script demonstrates how to perform semantic similarity analysis using Python. Semantic similarity is a measure of how close two pieces of text are in meaning, regardless of their surface form or syntactic differences.

The script likely leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and embeddings to convert text into vector representations, then computes similarity scores between these vectors.

### üß† Human Analogies
To better understand semantic similarity, consider these everyday examples:

1. **üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Menus**: Imagine two different restaurants with different menus. One describes a dish as "grilled chicken breast with roasted vegetables" while another calls it "flame-seared poultry with garden-fresh sides." Though the wording is completely different, they're describing essentially the same meal. Semantic similarity would recognize these descriptions as highly similar despite using different words.

2. **üé¨ Movie Plot Descriptions**: If someone says "A farm boy discovers he has magical powers and joins rebels to defeat an evil empire" and another person says "A young man from a rural area learns he has special abilities and helps freedom fighters overthrow a tyrannical regime," semantic similarity would recognize these are describing the same basic story, even though they share few identical words.

Just as humans can recognize when different phrases mean the same thing, semantic similarity algorithms try to capture this deeper understanding of language.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
To run this script, you'll need:
* Python 3.6+
* Required packages:
  * numpy
  * spaCy or sentence-transformers
  * pandas (for data handling)
  
You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install numpy spacy pandas sentence-transformers
```

For spaCy, you'll also need to download a language model:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

## üöÄ Usage
To use the script:

1. Import the script or run it directly from the command line:
   ```
   python 01_04_SemanticSimilarity.py
   ```

2. The script likely accepts text inputs for comparison or can process text files.

3. The output will be similarity scores ranging from 0 to 1, where:
   * 0 indicates completely dissimilar texts
   * 1 indicates identical meaning

## üìå Notes
* Semantic similarity differs from lexical similarity (which focuses on word overlap) by capturing meaning rather than just word matches.
* Different embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) can give different results.
* Consider preprocessing your text (removing stopwords, lemmatization) for potentially better results.
* The script may use cosine similarity as the distance metric, which is common for comparing text embeddings.

For more advanced applications, consider fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data or exploring other similarity metrics beyond cosine similarity.
